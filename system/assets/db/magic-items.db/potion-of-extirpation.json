You can pour the potion on one object or creature filling up to a close area. The target is utterly removed from reality and cannot be returned by anything short of a <em>wish</em> spell.</p><p></p><p><strong>Personality</strong>. Chaotic. Protests loudly while being used and never agrees that the target is the right choice for extirpation.</p>",
